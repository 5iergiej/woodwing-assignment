## Assignment: “Distance calculator”

Goal: Make a web service that accepts two distances (numbers) and returns the total distance
(sum of both).

Specifications: For each of the two distances, the requester can specify a unit, either Meters or
Yards.

Also for the returned total distance, the requester must specify a unit as well.
For example, the request could be 3 Yards + 5 Meters = ... Meters, and the response would be
7.73 Meters.
